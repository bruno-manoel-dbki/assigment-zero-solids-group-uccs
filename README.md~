### Learning Process


Compute the energy and structure of a grain boundary in an FCC material using molecular dynamics. 


FCC - Face-Centered Cubic Atomic

FCC materials - Aluminum, calcium, nickel, copper, silver...



## METHOD

FIND THE LATTICE CONSTANT AND CORRESPONDING COHESIVE ENERGY OF ALUMINIUM USING ONE BOX WITH A UNIQUE ELEMENT. APPLYING THE SCRIPT IN LAMMP was possibile to find the lattice constant and the cohesive energy

In the next step the simulation goes in the grainboundary calculation. To perform this action, was necessary to create two regions on the 

CREATE A
